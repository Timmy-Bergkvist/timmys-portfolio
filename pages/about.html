                            <h5>Who am I?</h5>
                            <p>
                                I am 31 years old and live with my girlfriend and our two cats in Stockholm.
                                We have previously lived in Norway for a few years, but decided three years ago to move back home to Sweden, so that we could be closer to our family and friends.
                                I am a calm yet adventurous person, who likes to try new things.
                                A healthy routine and disciplined everyday life is important to me and I think it's fun to be in charge for activities that my friends and I participate in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have a background in industry and have always had an interest in technology, computers and video games.
                                My curiosity about how things work led me to start renovating retro gadgets, e.g. video and arcade games. A dream would be to build an arcade game from scratch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my previous occupation, I have been involved and responsible for projects such as painting lifting tools for NASA, mining drills for Atlas Copco and various robot tools for ABB.
                                At Alfalaval, I helped working out solutions to streamline the workflow.
                            </p>
                        
                            <h5>My situation today</h5>
                            <p>
                                I have just finished a 9 month full stack training via Code Institute.
                                During the education I made my own apps with languages ​​like HTML, Css, JavaScript and Python. I have worked with databases and hosting platforms such as Heroku and Amazon's AWS.
                                For the past three years, I have also been studying Blockchain and its use around Bitcoin and crypto. I have taken several courses, participated in online events and explain and help people who want to learn to invest.
                            </p>
                        
                            <h5>Free time</h5>
                            <p>
                                In my free time I like to hang out with friends, play board games, code, hike and study subjects such as psychology, economics and health.
                                I like to challenge myself in different sports, crafts and stamina. When I lived in Norway, I started as a beginner in kickboxing and eventually participated to some fights.
                                In 2018, I decided to go on my biggest adventure so far and hiked through the UK, all alone.
                                From Land’s end in the south of England to John o’Groats in the north of Scotland.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h5>Short and long term goals</h5>
                            <p>
                                My short-term goals right now are mainly to learn what it is like to work in different teams and how I can contribute my knowledge to move projects forward.
                                I would like to travel more and try what it is like to work from different countries and places.
                                The long-term goal I have is to become an independent programmer who can freelance and work globally.
                                Project management interests me as I get involved in seeing the whole process, from idea to finished product.
                                I would like to develop into a mentor and help new programmers in the beginning of their career.
